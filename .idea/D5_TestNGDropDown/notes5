ASSERTIONS:
-> Assertions are coming from TestNG
-> Assertions alLows us to do our verification for our test cages
-> You can pass an additional argument into assertion methods just to provide additional information about what failed.
// to be able to print on the console


› assertEquals :
- This method expected two arguments to be passed: actual, expected.
It compares these two values and if they are exact match, it will pass.


__› assertTrue :
_ This method expects you to pass a boolean value. Or you have to pass a method that returns a boolean value.
- If the boolean value is TRUE, it will pass. If not it will fail.


--> assertFalse:
- This method expects you to pass a boolean value.
- If the boolean value is FALSE, IT WILL PASS. If not, it will fail.
--> If you assertion fails, it will stop running for the current test in the same Line where it failed.
It will move to the next test. And start running that one.

HOW DO IGNORE TEST
1 -add @ignore on top of the test
in what order the tests are running if we have multiple tests?
by default tests are running in alphabetical order case sensitive capital come first
priority => you can change the running order using priority
we can change the priority which will change  the running order of the tests

how do we handle dropdowns using selenium?

how many types of dropdown are there?

How do we handle dropdowns using Selenium?

HOW MANY TYPES OF DROPDOWN ARE THERE?


1- Select dropdowns: are created by using ‹select> tag in HTML
«select>
coption value="1"> option1 </option> coption value="2"> option2 </options! coption value="3"> option3 </option>
</select>
--use select class to locate them.
2- HTML dropdowns: these are the dropdowns that are created NOT USING «select>
- These dropdowns are handled just like any other webElement you will see on the page.
