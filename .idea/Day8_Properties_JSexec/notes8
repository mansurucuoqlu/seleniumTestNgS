What is hardcoding?
-harcoding means passing every data inside of class without using any utils or files
-> if you hard code, to be able to change the test data you have to go to each test and change the data from there.
-Data Driven Testing is runking the same test against different datas.
- instead of hardcoding tes data inside of test
- We created a properties file and we keep our test data in the file. we also used DataProvider annotations from TestNg to be able to do DDT

PropertiesReading utility class
-> to be able to read from properties type of file, we created util class.
-> steps to read from properties file:
1- Creating the object from Properties class
Properties properties = new Properties);
2- We need to OPEN the file in
FileInputStream file = new FileInputStream("path");
3- We need to load the file to properties object.
properties. load(file);
4- We close the previously opened file
file .close);

//by hiding properties object and getting this object in the getter method is basically an example of encapsulation

--> JavaScriptExecutor :
for some actions that selenium that able to handle
javaScriptexecutor is an interface that helps to execute javcascript trough selenuym webdriver
javascrpitexecutor provides two methods "executescript" &"executeAsyncscript"
to run javascrpot on the selected window or current page
this method executes javascropt in the context of the currently selected frame or window in selenium


JavaScriptExecutor:
1- We create javascriptExecutor object and we cast our WebDriver type instance into JavascriptExecutor tyr
JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
2- Then we have access to the methods that are coming from JavascriptExecutor interface. js.executeScript (Script, Arguments);
For arguments scrooldown , click ,window.open etc..
- - you will prefer to use when you are not able to do some actions with selenium
Scroll in Selenium?
-with selenium itself you are not able to scroll in the page you need
1-JSExecutor
The syntax of ScrollBy() methods is :
executeScript("window .scrollBy (x-pixels, y-pixels)");
x-pixels is the number at x-axis,
it moves to the left if number is positive and it move to the right if number is negative y-pixels is the number at y-axis,
it moves to the down if number is positive and it move to the up if number is in negative

DRIVER UTILITY
- initialize the driver without coding too many line for each class
- Being able to pass the same driver instance when calling methods from other classes
SingLeton Design pattern in DriverUtil:
-> He create a private constructor, and we also create a getter method to allow users to create the instance of this class from getter.
-> You cannot create an object of that class because you ade Priavete Constractor
--there will be always one instance of driver with singleton design pattern
--achive our gol from one instance

Headless browser: The only difference between regular browser, headles-browser is: headless ones does not get open in the machine.
-headles one will excute your code faster.

ACTIONS:
Actions class is a collection of individual Action that you want to perform.
-> Actions class allows us to handle mouse and keyboard actions on the web pages.
For Example:
-> hover over : moveToElement
-> right click: contextcLick
-> dragAndDrop: allows us to drag and drop a web element
-> cLickAndHold: clicks onto something and waits for next command
-> release
1- To get Actions methods, we need to create the instance of the actions class.
2- And pass the driver instance into the constructor.
3- We must use: perform) method at the end to be able to perform any actions method.
