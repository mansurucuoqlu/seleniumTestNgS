/*
//driver.findelement(By.classname("gLyf  fsa")).sendkeys()///....
if classname has space in it it is good idea to yuse mos of case you wikll recieve an error
driver,findelmeent (by.classname "gLyf") .sendkeys"Apple" is works sometimes bbut its not unmieque thats why we gotta use more unique attribute

//if webelement also has classname attribute but its not unique its is not good idea to use
//if id is dynamic means when youi refresh the page and if you see id is changing that means dynameic it wont work and nuique


6-tagName
--iyou locate using tagbname itself
--the usage of this one not too much
--it is good if you want to pring same tag names


for ex : if you wanna print all links in the page then you will use thios method
driver.findelement(by.tagname(a))
driver.findelement(by.tagname(div))

*/*/*/*/*/*/
utilities package i
the reason is we usiong ustilities its makes our cod more reusable
easy to maintance
in the future if you wanna change something instead of going each class you will only chanmge from utilities
