How do we handle wed tables using Selenium webdriver?
 -> He create specific path locators to locate what we want to get from the table itself.
 How do we handle web tables?
 By creating custom Locators to get whatever I need to get from the table.
 -> If I need to get the whole row, I create a Locator that returns me the whole row.
 -> If I need to get 1 single cell, I need to create a Locator that returns me 1 single cell.
  //table[aid= ct100 MainContent _orderGrid' ]/tbody/tr
 //table [aid='ct00 MainContent orderGrid'1//tr

 ALERTS
 There are two types of alerts.
 1- HTML Alerts:
 -> How do we handle: We just locate just as another web element on the page,
 -> Then we click.
 2- JavaScript Alerts:
 HOW DO WE HANDLE ALERTS?
 -> Using Alerts.
 -> JS alerts are not part of the HTML structure. Therefore we need to switch the driver focus to the
 alert itself.

 1- Create an instance of Alert, then switch to alert.
 Alert alert = driver.switchTo).alert;
 2- to accept, dismiss

 IFRAMES
 -> Iframes are basically <html> inside of another <html>
 -> Selenium can only focus one thing at a time.
 So we need to SWITCH driver's focus to the inner frame to be able to perform any action with Selenium.
 -> There are 3 ways to switch to frames
 1- Locating as WebElement then using that webElement to switch.
 WebELement iframe = driver. findElement(LOCATOR);
 driver.switchTo.frame (iframe);
 2- Switching by index. We pass the index number of the frame.
 -> if you have more than one iframe on the page, indexes are used.
 <iframe>
 --> index @
 <iframe>
 -> index 1
 <iframe>
 --> index 2

 driver.switchTo..frame(0);
 3-Switching by id or name attribute vlaue
 driver.switchTo.frame("idValue")
 driver.switchTo.frame(nameValue")
